# Yelp Ratings Project Phases 1 and 2

In phases 1 and 2, we collected two sets of data: the median income of California zip codes and Yelp reviews about restaurants in those zip codes. We stored that data in a MongoDB Atlas Cluster in phase 1 and cleaned up the data in phase 2.


# Yelp Rating Project Phase 3

In phase 3, we will take this cleaned data and insert it into a model in order ro perform predictions on the data.
